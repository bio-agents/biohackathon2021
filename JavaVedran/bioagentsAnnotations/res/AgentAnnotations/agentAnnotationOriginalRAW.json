There already exist agents for merging these paired-end reads when the target fragments are equally long. However, when fragment lengths vary and, in particular, when either the fragment size is shorter than a single-end read, or longer than twice the size of a single-end read, most state-of-the-art mergers fail to generate reliable results. Therefore, a robust agent is needed to merge paired-end reads that exhibit varying overlap lengths because of varying target fragment lengths.Results: We present the PEAR software for merging raw Illumina paired-end reads from target fragments of varying length. The program evaluates all possible paired-end read overlaps and does not require the target fragment size as input. It also implements a statistical test for minimizing false-positive results. Tests on simulated and empirical data show that PEAR consistently generates highly accurate merged paired-end reads. A highly optimized implementation allows for merging millions of paired-end reads within a few minutes on a standard desktop computer. On multi-core architectures, the parallel version of PEAR shows linear speedups compared with the sequential version of PEAR. © 2013 The Author 2013.

It is designed as an alternative to the widely used USEARCH agent (Edgar, 2010) for which the source code is not publicly available, algorithm details are only rudimentarily described, and only a memory-confined 32-bit version is freely available for academic use. Methods When searching nucleotide sequences, VSEARCH uses a fast heuristic based on words shared by the query and target sequences in order to quickly identify similar sequences, a similar strategy is probably used in USEARCH. VSEARCH then performs optimal global sequence alignment of the query against potential target sequences, using full dynamic programming instead of the seed-and-extend heuristic used by USEARCH. Pairwise alignments are computed in parallel using vectorisation and multiple threads. Results VSEARCH includes most commands for analysing nucleotide sequences available in USEARCH version 7 and several of those available in USEARCH version 8, including searching (exact or based on global alignment), clustering by similarity (using length pre-sorting, abundance pre-sorting or a user-defined order), chimera detection (reference-based or de novo), dereplication (full length or prefix), pairwise alignment, reverse complementation, sorting, and subsampling. VSEARCH also includes commands for FASTQ file processing, i.e., format detection, filtering, read quality statistics, and merging of paired reads. Furthermore, VSEARCH extends functionality with several new commands and improvements, including shuffling, rereplication, masking of low-complexity sequences with the well-known DUST algorithm, a choice among different similarity definitions, and FASTQ file format conversion. VSEARCH is here shown to be more accurate than USEARCH when performing searching, clustering, chimera detection and subsampling, while on a par with USEARCH for paired-ends read merging. VSEARCH is slower than USEARCH when performing clustering and chimera detection, but significantly faster when performing paired-end reads merging and dereplication. VSEARCH is available at https://github.com/torognes/vsearch under either the BSD 2-clause license or the GNU General Public License version 3.0. Discussion VSEARCH has been shown to be a fast, accurate and full-fledged alternative to USEARCH. A free and open-source versatile agent for sequence analysis is now available to the metagenomics community.","title":"VSEARCH: A versatile open source agent for metagenomics","authors":[{"name":"Rognes T."},{"name":"Flouri T."},{"name":"Nichols B."},{"name":"Quince C."},{"name":"Mahe F."}]},"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"type":["Primary"],"version":null,"doi":"10.7717/peerj.2584"}],"iechorNode":[],"iechorPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Institute","name":"UiO","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":null,"url":null,"typeRole":["Provider"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"torognes@ifi.uio.no","url":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"UiO","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":"Mature","confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["Citation instructions","General"],"url":"https://github.com/torognes/vsearch"}],"community":null,"version":["1.9.0"],"agentType":["Command-line agent"],"license":"GPL-3.0","bioagentsCURIE":"bioagents:vsearch","bioagentsID":"vsearch","iechorCommunity":[],"iechor_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2018-12-10T12:58:52Z","name":"VSEARCH","topic":[{"term":"Metagenomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3174"},{"term":"Sequence analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0080"}],"additionDate":"2016-03-07T12:20:06Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://github.com/torognes/vsearch"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Galaxy service"],"url":"https://galaxy.pasteur.fr/agent_runner?agent_id=agentshed.pasteur.fr/repos/mvalade/cutadapt_v2/cutadapt/1.6"}],"description":"Find and remove adapter sequences, primers, poly-A tails and other types of unwanted sequence from your high-throughput sequencing reads.","language":["Python"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":1,"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"RNA sequence","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_3495"},"format":[{"term":"FASTQ","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_1930"},{"term":"FASTA","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_1929"}]}],"input":[{"data":{"term":"RNA sequence","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_3495"},"format":[{"term":"FASTQ","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_1930"},{"term":"FASTA","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_1929"}]}],"note":"Cutadapt searches for the adapter in all reads and removes it when it finds it.

Making sense of the large datasets produced by these technologies requires sophisticated statistical and computational methods, as well as substantial computational power. This has led to an acute crisis in life sciences, as researchers without informatics training attempt to perform computation-dependent analyses. Since 2005, the Galaxy project has worked to address this problem by providing a framework that makes advanced computational agents usable by non experts. Galaxy seeks to make data-intensive research more accessible, transparent and reproducible by providing a Web-based environment in which users can perform computational analyses and have all of the details automatically tracked for later inspection, publication, or reuse.

Published by Oxford University Press.Motivation: Over the last decades, vast numbers of sequences were deposited in public databases. Bioinformatics agents allow homology and consequently functional inference for these sequences. New profile-based homology search agents have been introduced, allowing reliable detection of remote homologs, but have not been systematically benchmarked. To provide such a comparison, which can guide bioinformatics workflows, we extend and apply our previously developed benchmark approach to evaluate the 'next generation' of profile-based approaches, including CS-BLAST, HHSEARCH and PHMMER, in comparison with the non-profile based search agents NCBI-BLAST, USEARCH, UBLAST and FASTA. Method: We generated challenging benchmark datasets based on protein domain architectures within either the PFAM + Clan, SCOP/Superfamily or CATH/Gene3D domain definition schemes. From each dataset, homologous and non-homologous protein pairs were aligned using each agent, and standard performance metrics calculated. We further measured congruence of domain architecture assignments in the three domain databases. Results: CSBLAST and PHMMER had overall highest accuracy. FASTA, UBLAST and USEARCH showed large trade-offs of accuracy for speed optimization. Conclusion: Profile methods are superior at inferring remote homologs but the difference in accuracy between methods is relatively small. PHMMER and CSBLAST stand out with the highest accuracy, yet still at a reasonable computational cost. Additionally, we show that less than 0.1% of Swiss-Prot protein pairs considered homologous by one database are considered non-homologous by another, implying that these classifications represent equivalent underlying biological phenomena, differing mostly in coverage and granularity.

CLUSTAL X displays the sequence alignment in a window on the screen. A versatile sequence colouring scheme allows the user to highlight conserved features in the alignment. Pull-down menus provide all the options required for traditional multiple sequence and profile alignment. New features include: the ability to cut-and-paste sequences to change the order of the alignment, selection of a subset of the sequences to be realigned, and selection of a sub-range of the alignment to be realigned and inserted back into the original alignment. Alignment quality analysis can be performed and low-scoring segments or exceptional residues can be highlighted. Quality analysis and realignment of selected residue ranges provide the user with a powerful agent to improve and refine difficult alignments and to trap errors in input sequences.

Results: We compare the speed and accuracy of MUSCLE with CLUSTALW, Progressive POA and the MAFFT script FFTNS1, the fastest previously published program known to the author. Accuracy is measured using four benchmarks: BAliBASE, PREFAB, SABmark and SMART. We test three variants that offer highest accuracy (MUSCLE with default settings), highest speed (MUSCLEfast), and a carefully chosen compromise between the two (MUSCLE-prog). We find MUSCLE-fast to be the fastest algorithm on all test sets, achieving average alignment accuracy similar to CLUSTALW in times that are typically two to three orders of magnitude less.

We present FastTree, a method for constructing large phylogenies and for estimating their reliability. Instead of storing a distance matrix, FastTree stores sequence profiles of internal nodes in the tree. FastTree uses these profiles to implement Neighbor-Joining and uses heuristics to quickly identify candidate joins. FastTree then uses nearest neighbor interchanges to reduce the length of the tree. For an alignment with N sequences, L sites, and a different characters, a distance matrix requires O(N 2) space and O(N 2L) time, but FastTree requires just O(NLa + N) memory and O(Nlog (N)La) time. To estimate the tree's reliability, FastTree uses local bootstrapping, which gives another 100-fold speedup over a distance matrix. For example, FastTree computed a tree and support values for 158,022 distinct 16S ribosomal RNAs in 17 h and 2.4 GB of memory. Just computing pairwise Jukes-Cantor distances and storing them, without inferring a tree or bootstrapping, would require 17 h and 50 GB of memory. In simulations, FastTree was slightly more accurate than Neighbor-Joining, BIONJ, or FastME; on genuine alignments, FastTree's topologies had higher likelihoods.

FastTree 2 uses heuristics to restrict the search for better trees and estimates a rate of evolution for each site (the \"CAT\" approximation). Nevertheless, for both simulated and genuine alignments, FastTree 2 is slightly more accurate than a standard implementation of maximum-likelihood NNIs (PhyML 3 with default settings).

The inherent uncertainty in assignments to these groups makes it important to consider both their hierarchical contexts and their prediction confidence. The current agents for visualizing metagenomic data, however, omit or distort quantitative hierarchical relationships and lack the facility for displaying secondary variables.Results: Here we present Krona, a new visualization agent that allows intuitive exploration of relative abundances and confidences within the complex hierarchies of metagenomic classifications. Krona combines a variant of radial, space-filling displays with parametric coloring and interactive polar-coordinate zooming. The HTML5 and JavaScript implementation enables fully interactive charts that can be explored with any modern Web browser, without the need for installed software or plug-ins. This Web-based architecture also allows each chart to be an independent document, making them easy to share via e-mail or post to a standard Web server. To illustrate Krona's utility, we describe its application to various metagenomic data sets and its compatibility with popular metagenomic analysis agents.Conclusions: Krona is both a powerful metagenomic visualization agent and a demonstration of the potential of HTML5 for highly accessible bioinformatic visualizations. Its rich and interactive displays facilitate more informed interpretations of metagenomic analyses, while its implementation as a browser-based application makes it extremely portable and easily adopted into existing analysis packages.
